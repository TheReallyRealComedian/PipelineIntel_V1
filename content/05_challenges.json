Ultracentrifugation using cesium chloride or iodixanol gradients can achieve separation but is not scalable to commercial manufacturing and exposes product to harsh conditions.

Achieving consistent polymorphic form requires precise control of supersaturation, temperature gradients, nucleation conditions, anti-solvent addition rates, and crystallization time. Each polymorph must be characterized and the desired form demonstrated stable under manufacturing and storage conditions.

Guide RNAs can tolerate several base mismatches, potentially creating hundreds to thousands of potential off-target sites genome-wide. Although off-target mutation frequencies are typically low (<1%), any unintended mutations in production cell lines could affect productivity, product quality, or genetic stability, while in therapeutic cells they could compromise patient safety. Comprehensive off-target screening using whole-genome sequencing is required but costly ($5,000-15,000 per clone) and time-intensive.
